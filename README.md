# Minc extension

This extension adds the support of MicroShift.

By using this extension, it is possible to create Kubernetes clusters
running on top of the container engine. Note that installing the `minc`
binary is a prerequisite to using the Minc extension.

You can initialize a MicroShift cluster using the Resources section in Settings
once the `minc` binary is installed on your machine.
